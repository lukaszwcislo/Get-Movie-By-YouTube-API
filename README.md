# Get-Movie-By-YouTube-API
Animation countdown layer - getting movie by YouTube API

PREVIEW: https://lukaszwcislo.github.io/Get-Movie-By-YouTube-API/

A simple page with a form included.

You can enter the YouTube video ID (or the entire link) in the text field. Then, after pressing the button to send the form (without reloading the page!) Via API, it is embedded on the YouTube player page with this video. The movie starts playing automatically.

10 seconds before the end of the movie, a layer appears above the movie, counting down how many seconds are left to the end of the movie. This layer does not block the possibility of jumping to another part of the movie (you can click freely on the progress bar).

You can load a different movie at any time (enter a different movie ID or link).
